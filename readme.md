# Javascript Quiz

This challenge took every bit of the week we had to complete, I worked on this project with Devin Clark, and Jacob Carcerano. We managed to reach a few stretch goals, such as a progress bar and coloration of the answers depending on whether they are correct or not. The highscores page is a pop up window that shows the scores of multiple players even after reloaded. We also decided to add bootstrap to help us with our styling.
